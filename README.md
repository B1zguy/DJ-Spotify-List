# DJ-Spotify-List

The goal of this unfinished project is to be able to compare and manage my DJing music between Spotify and iTunes. This program is still at its research stages: trying to perfect the match algorithm (since Spotify's list and iTunes' list need be compared).

Upon completion, I'll be able to see what songs haven't been downloaded (in iTunes).

Perhaps this git project will just be the song matching algorithm and have a separate project for the complete program.
